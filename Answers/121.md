# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

---

### 🎯 Goal:
Find **the biggest difference** between a low price (buy) and a higher price that comes after it (sell) — this is your **profit**.

---

### 💡 Step-by-step Breakdown:

```python
min_price = prices[0]
```
- ➤ Start by saying: “Let’s assume the first price is the lowest I’ve seen so far.”
- (You need to **buy at the lowest price** to make profit.)

---

```python
max_profit = 0
```
- ➤ You haven’t made any money yet, so your profit starts at **0**.

---

```python
for price in prices:
```
- ➤ Now, go through each price in the list one by one.

---

```python
    if price < min_price:
        min_price = price
```
- ➤ If today’s price is **cheaper** than your lowest so far, update your **buy price**.
- (You found a better deal — so remember it!)

---

```python
    elif price - min_price > max_profit:
        max_profit = price - min_price
```
- ➤ If today’s price minus your lowest price so far gives you a **better profit**, update your **best profit**.
- (You’re checking: “What if I sold today? Would I make more money than before?”)

---

```python
return max_profit
```
- ➤ At the end, return the best profit you could’ve made.

---

### 🧠 Example:
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
```

1. First price = 7 → set as `min_price`
2. See 1 → it's lower! New `min_price = 1`
3. See 5 → profit = 5 - 1 = 4 → `max_profit = 4`
4. See 3 → profit = 3 - 1 = 2 → not better than 4
5. See 6 → profit = 6 - 1 = 5 → better! → `max_profit = 5`
6. See 4 → profit = 4 - 1 = 3 → not better than 5

✅ Final answer: **5**

### 🔁 Think of it like:
You're walking through a store. Each price is a new shelf.  
- You remember the **cheapest price so far**.
- At each shelf, you ask: “If I had bought at the cheapest price I saw before, how much profit would I make if I sold now?”
